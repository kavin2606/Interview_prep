Contains the actual questions of all the code.

question 1:
This problem was recently asked by Google.
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
(Time took to solve: 21 mins, did i google any syntax: yes)
